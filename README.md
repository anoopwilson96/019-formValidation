This is a form validation using JavaScript. I created a signup page for an online chatting website '24 x 7 chat'. The signup page asks for a Name, a valid email ID, and a strong password.
Highlights:
✅If the user submits the form without filling it, it will display an error message.

✅Each input field has its error message which appears if the user input doesn't meet the requirements.

✅The user input for the password and email address should meet the special requirements such as proper email format and the Password must meet complexity requirements.

✅The password is requested twice so that the user doesn't make mistakes by entering wrong passwords.
